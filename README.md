## Intro to github project menagment

A brief info for setting up git workflow on windows. Probably the simplest way would be to install Github Desktop.
Here is the link to the installation page

https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop/

More info about how to configure everything

https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/getting-started-with-github-desktop/

They also have some tutorials for how to use the app to contribute to projects

https://help.github.com/desktop/guides/contributing-to-projects/


Here are some hopefully useful link if you want to understand more about the git version control (this is more general info and not specific to github)

## Gitter

This is also new for me, but it seems like a usefull tool for communication 
about projects (at least more practical then email). It is an instant messaging 
and chat room for users of github repositories.  

Some info about how it works and how to use can be found here

## General structure of the repository

I have added few folders for now to structure the rep. The word file that you sent me is 
in docs folder. I will also add some matlab code to the code folder. The notes folder 
could be usefull for writting quick comments on current problems or setting up todo lists. 
A nice thing about github is that supports markdown, a lightwaight markup language with 
plain text formating syntax. For example this Readme.md file is written in markdown. Some 
basic syntax info can be found here
