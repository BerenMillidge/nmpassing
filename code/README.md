run_test.m -> run the simulations

discrete_bernoulli_process.m -> generative process of a non-stationary 
bernoulli process with finite number of distinct probabilities.

bp_algo.m -> belief propagation alghorithm that in the case of 
sequential inference problem corresponds to the  forward-backward 
algorithm 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward%E2%80%93backward_algorithm

var_algo.m -> variational message passing. Seems quite bad in comparison 
to BP, maybe needs debugging or changing the implementation.

ep_algo.m -> expectation propagation. Not implemented.
